In the course of normal operations, MistOSTs will request that you provide your Steam username and password.  These are sent via Termux and tmux to SteamCMD, which may cache the credentials locally, as well as forward them to Steam servers for authentication, and could theoretically do anything else with them and I wouldn't know.  MistOSTs does not itself store the credentials, nor transmit them anywhere other than described.
